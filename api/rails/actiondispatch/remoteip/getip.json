When the request is proxied by another\nserver like HAProxy or NGINX, the IP address that made the original\nrequest will be put in an X-Forwarded-For header. If there are multiple\nproxies, that header may contain a list of IPs. Other proxy services\nset the Client-Ip header instead, so we check that too.\n\nAs discussed in {this post about Rails IP Spoofing}[http://blog.gingerlime.com/2012/rails-ip-spoofing-vulnerabilities-and-protection/],\nwhile the first IP in the list is likely to be the \"originating\" IP,\nit could also have been set by the client maliciously.\n\nIn order to find the first address that is (probably) accurate, we\ntake the list of IPs, remove known and trusted proxies, and then take\nthe last address left, which was presumably set by one of those proxies.",
