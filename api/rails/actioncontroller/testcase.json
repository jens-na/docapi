  "RaiseActionExceptions": "When the request.remote_addr remains the default for testing, which is 0.0.0.0, the exception is simply raised inline\n(skipping the regular exception handling from rescue_action). If the request.remote_addr is anything else, the regular\nrescue_action process takes place. This means you can test your rescue_action code by setting remote_addr to something else\nthan 0.0.0.0.\n\nThe exception is stored in the exception accessor for further inspection."
